    Specify the paths that you'd like to sparse checkout. This may be used for saving space (Think about a reference repository)
    Be sure to use a recent version of Git, at least above 1.7.10. Note that restricting the checkout to certain paths will also
    filter the changelog to only show changes for those paths.
